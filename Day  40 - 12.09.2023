-- Stream ingestion scenarios

Azure Synapse provides multiple ways to analyze large volume data. Two of the most common approaches to large-scale data analytics are:

1) Data Warehouses - relational databases optimized for distributed storage and query processesing. Data is stored in tables and queries using SQL.

2) Data lakes - distributed file storage in which data is stored as files that can be processed and queried using multiple runtimes, including Apache Spark and SQL.
