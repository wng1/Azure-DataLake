-- Encapsulate data transformation in a stored procedure

While you can run the CETAS in a script whenever you need to transform data, it is good practice to encapsulate the transformation operation in a stored procedure.

This approach can make it easier to operationalize data transformations by enabling you to:

1) supply parameters
2) retrieve outputs
3) include additional logic in a single procedure call
