Analytical Data Processing typically uses read-only systems that store vast volumes of historical data or business metrics.

Data files may be stored in a central data lake for analysis. ETL copies data from files and OLTP databases into data warehouse that is 
optimized for read activity.

Commonly, a data warehouse schema is based on fact tables that contain numeric values you want to analyze (for example, sales amounts),
with related dimension tables that represent the entities by which you want to measure them (for example, customer or product),


The data in the data lake, data warehouse, and analytical model can be queried to produce reports, visualizations, and dashboards.

Data lakes are common in large-scale data analytical processing scenarios, where a large volume of file-based data must 
be collected and analyzed.
