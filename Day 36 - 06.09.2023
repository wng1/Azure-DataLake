The Parquet format is typically preferred for data files that you will use for further analysis or ingestion into an analytical store.
Parquet is a very efficient format that is supported by most large scale data analytics systems. 
In fact, sometimes your data transformation requirement may simply be to convert data from another format (such as CSV) to Parquet!


from pyspark.sql.functions import year, col

df = spark.read.csv('________________', header=True, inferSchema=True)
dated_df = df.withColumn("Year", year(col("OrderDate")))

# The folder name is generated when partioning a dataframe include the partitioning column name and value in column=value format, as shown here:

dated_df.write.partitionBy("Year").mode("overwrite").parquest("/data")



#Filter parquet files in a query

When reading data from parquet files into a dataframe, you have the ability to pull data from any folder within the hierarchical folders. 
This filtering process is done with the use of explicit values and wildcards against the partitioned fields.

In the following example, the following code will pull the sales orders, which were placed in 2020.

orders_2020 = spark.read.parquet('_____________')
display(order_2020.limit(5))




#Transform data with SQL

THe SparkSQL Library, which provides the dataframe structure also enables you to use SQL as a way of working with data. 
With this approahc, you can "query" and "transform" data in dataframes by using SQL queries, and "persist" the results as tables.

External Tables are "loosely bound" to the underlyign files and deleting the table does not delete the files.
This allows you to use Spark to do the heavy lifting of transformation then persist the data in the lake. After this is done you can
drop the table and downstream processes can access these optimized structures.
