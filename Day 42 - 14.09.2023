##Visualize real-time data with Azure Stream Analytics and Power BI

By combining the stream processing capabilities of Azure Stream Analytics and the data visualization capabilities of Microsoft Power BI, you can create real-time data dashboards.

- Configure a Stream Analytics outputs for Power BI
- Use a Stream Analytics query to write data to Power BI
- Create a real-time data visualization in Power BI

Azure Stream Analytics --> Azure Event Hubs ---> Power BI dataset (dashboard)

ASA include:
Azure Event Hubs
Azure IoT Hubs
Azure Blob or Data Lake Gen 2 Storage

Depending on the specific input type, the data for each streamed event includes the event's data fields and input-specific metadata fields. For example, data consumed from an Azure Event Hubs input includes an EventEnqueuedUtcTime field indicating the time when the event was received in the event hub.

Power BI output to write the results of a Stream Analytics query to a table in a Power BI streaming dataset, from where it can be visualized in a dashboard. 
When adding a Power BI output to a Stream Analytics job, you need to specify the following properties:

Output alias:
Group workspace:
Dataset name:
Table name:
Authorize connection:

##Create a query for real-time visualization
To send streaming data into Power BI, your Azure Synapse Analytics job uses a query that writes its results to a Power BI output. A simple query that forward events data from an event hub directly to Power BI might look like this:

SELECT
	EventEnqueuedUtcTime As ReadingTime,
	SensorID,
	ReadingValue
INTO
	[powerbi-output]
FROM
	[eventhub-input] TIMESTAMP BY EventEnqueuedTime

Customer or Analyst or Engineer may want to query or drill down further to filter, aggregate the data, sending only relevant or summarized data to the Power BI dataset.

SELECT
	DateAdd(second, -60, System.TimeStamp) AS StartTime,
	System.TimeStamp AS EndTime,
	SensorID,
	MAX(ReadingValue) AS MaxReading
INTO
	[powerbi-output]
FROM
	[eventhub-input] TIMESTAMP By EventEnqueuedUtcTime
WHERE SensorID <> 0
GROUP BY SensorID, TumblingWindow(second, 60)
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1

##Create Real-Time Data Visualizations in Power BI
When you successfully run an Azure Stream Analytics job that sends result to Power BI output, a streaming data set containing a single table is created in Power BI workspace specified for the output.
The table contains the data produced by the Stream Analytics query.
