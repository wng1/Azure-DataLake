https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/analyze-azure-blob-storage-performance-indicators/

As a cloud administrator responsible for optimizing use of Azure resources, you need to identify the solution that would reconcile these two seemingly conflicting goals.  To accomplish this 
objective, you decide to explore the performance characteristics and the pricing model of Azure Blob Storage, focusing on the use of Azure Premium Blob Storage.


700 million read operations
300 million write operations

30 days using 5 Terabyters

Calculate the Results  TPS/TB  (Transaction per second / Terabytes

$${o = \frac{ n }{ d\ \times\ h\ \times\ m\ \times\ s }}$$

Where the variables are defined as follows:

    o = Operations per second
    n = Number of operations
    d = Days
    h = Hours
    m = Minutes
    s = Seconds

Using that formula, we can calculate the total transactions per second in the following examples:

    Write transactions per second = 300,000,000 / (30 x 24 x 60 x 60) = 116 (rounded to the nearest whole number)

    Read transactions per second = 700,000,000 / (30 x 24 x 60 x 60) = 270 (rounded to the nearest whole number)

    Total transactions per second = 270 + 116 = 386

    With 5 TB of data, this corresponds to 386 / 5 = 77 TPS/TB.
